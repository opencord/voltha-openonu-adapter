# DEPRECATED

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

`VOLTHA 2.6` was the last release that officially supported the `voltha-openonu-adapter` written in python as the onu adapter.
From `2.5` onwards the default ONU adapter is the [voltha-openonu-adapter-go](https://github.com/opencord/voltha-openonu-adapter-go). This codebase is going to be removed after the VOLTHA 2.8 release LTS support ends in December 2022.
